# Test Convention

All tests are decorated with either `testmode.standalone` or `testmode.integration`. The environment variable
`DSS_TEST_MODE` selects which type of tests to run. If the word "integration" is in `DSS_TEST_MODE`, then `make test`
will run integration tests. If the word "standalone" is in `DSS_TEST_MODE`, then`make test` will run standalone tests.
`DSS_TEST_MODE` can contain both words, in which case `make test` will run both sets of tests.

Standalone tests may only use the fixture and storage buckets in each replica. They may not use any other cloud
resources such as Elasticsearch instances, API gateway or Lambda functions.

Integration tests require cloud resource to run.

# How to Run

* `make test` will run tests based off the environment variable `DSS_TEST_MODE` value.

* `make integration_test` will run "integration" test cases.

* `make all_tests` will run "standalone" and "integration" tests.

* `make smoketest` will run the test_smoketest.py test suite.
